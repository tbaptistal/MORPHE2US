After running your MORPHE2US model, it's time to interpret the results and extract insights.

## ðŸ“ˆ 1. View Results in Spine Toolbox

Spine Toolbox provides a graphical interface to view:

- Energy flows
- Technology investments
- Operational schedules
- Emission trajectories
- Cost breakdowns

Use built-in visualizers or export tables to CSV.

**TODO**: how-to? check with Kacper or refer to section 3 below if you have a guide there. Questions to tackle here: in what format are the results output? How can they be accessed? What does the built-in visualizer allow and when is something external helpful/needed?

## ðŸ§  2. Common Questions to Ask

- Which technologies were selected, and when?
- What is the pathway to long-term decarbonization?
- What are the peak loads and how are they covered?
- Where are inefficiencies or curtailments happening?
- What is the total cost of the transition?

## ðŸ“¤ 3. Export and Report

You can export results to CSV/Excel to build reports or feed into dashboards.

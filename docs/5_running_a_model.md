# Running a Model

If you haven’t imported `output.json` into SpineOpt yet, start in **[Building a Model](4_building_a_model.md)**.

## 🛠️ Step x: Select and Configure a Solver for MIP problems

MORPHE2US (via SpineOpt) supports various optimization solvers. Choose one based on your performance needs:

## ▶️ Step 1: Run the Model

Directly within Spine Toolbox: 

1. Left-click on the `Project` Execute window in Spine Toolbox.
2. Monitor the log window for progress and any warnings/errors.

> 💡 **Tip:** For large models, expect longer runtimes. For fast iterations, start with short time horizons or fewer technologies.

**TODO** add screenshot for illustrative purposes

## 📁 Step 2: View and Export Results

Once the model completes:

- Open the output database to view results (automatically generated by SpineOpt).
- Use **Spine Toolbox visualizations** or export data to `.csv` or Excel.

Typical outputs include:

| Outputs                  | Description                               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Energy Flows`        | Hourly flows per technology and node      |
| `Invested capacity`         | Capacity additions by technology/year     |
| `Emissions`           | CO₂ emissions per time slice              |
| `Costs`           | By activity and node              |

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

If the model fails to run:

- ❌ **Infeasible model:** Check constraints (e.g., demand too high, no valid tech)
- ⚠️ **Missing inputs:** Ensure all time series and costs are present
- 🐌 **Too slow:** Try a smaller horizon or simpler tech mix

Use the log window in Spine Toolbox for detailed error messages and solver output.

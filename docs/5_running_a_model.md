# Running a Model

Once you have built and validated your MORPHE2US model, the next step is to run the optimization. This process simple involves executing the model in SpineToolbox, and ensuring results are correctly generated.

## 🛠️ Step x: Select and Configure a Solver for MIP problems

MORPHE2US (via SpineOpt) supports various optimization solvers. Choose one based on your performance needs:

## ▶️ Step 1: Run the Model

Directly within Spinetool Box: 

1. Left-click on the `Project` Execute window in Spinetool Box.
2. Monitor the log window for progress and any warnings/errors.

> 💡 **Tip:** For large models, expect longer runtimes. For fast iterations, start with short time horizons or fewer technologies.

## 📁 Step 2: View and Export Results

Once the model completes:

- Open the output database to view results (automatically generated by SpineOpt).
- Use **SpineToolbox visualizations** or export data to `.csv` or Excel.

Typical outputs include:

| Outputs                  | Description                               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Energy Flow`        | Hourly flows per technology and node      |
| `Investmented capacity`         | Capacity additions by technology/year     |
| `Emissions produced and traded`           | CO₂ emissions per time slice              |

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

If the model fails to run:

- ❌ **Infeasible model:** Check constraints (e.g., demand too high, no valid tech)
- ⚠️ **Missing inputs:** Ensure all time series and costs are present
- 🐌 **Too slow:** Try a smaller horizon or simpler tech mix

Use the log window in SpineToolbox for detailed error messages and solver output.

# About

**MORPHE2US** stands for **Municipal Optimization for Renewable Projects in Hydrogen & Energy Efficient Utility Solutions**.

It is an Excel-based techno-economic modeling framework designed to support **municipalities** in identifying location-specific, cost-optimal pathways to decarbonize their energy systems.

## Purpose

MORPHE2US helps cities and regions explore **decarbonization pathways** by converting techno-economic data into optimization-ready inputs for [SpineOpt](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl).
The tool provides a structured Excel interface that makes it possible to define technologies, demands, and system constraints, which are parsed via Python into `.json` files compatible with Spine Toolbox and SpineOpt.
providing an optimization-based approach to:

## Key Features

- ✅ **Flexible Technology Definition**: Include supply, conversion, and storage technologies  
- 🏘 **Spatial Flexibility**: Model municipalities with multiple districts and building archetypes  
- ⏱ **Temporal Resolution**: Support for single-year snapshots or multi-year transition pathways  
- 📦 **Infrastructure Options**: Represent both existing infrastructure (brownfield) and new investments (greenfield)  
- 💡 **Sector Coupling**: Gas, electricity, heat, and hydrogen in a single optimization
- 📚 **Community-Driven**: Active SpineOpt GitHub forum for bug reports, improvements, and knowledge sharing

## Architecture

The Excel model outputs a `.json` file that can be imported directly into a Spine database to run simulations using the open-source **SpineOpt** energy modeling framework. 
MORPHE2US consists of three main components:

1. **Excel Workbook**: User-friendly input interface for defining model specifications
2. **Python Pipeline**: Parses Excel and `.json` data into a model-ready format
3. **Spine Toolbox + SpineOpt**: Executes the optimization and visualizes results

## ðŸ“ˆ 1. View Results in SpineToolbox

SpineToolbox provides a graphical interface to view:

- Energy flows
- Technology investments
- Operational schedules
- Emission trajectories
- Cost breakdowns

Use built-in visualizers or export tables to CSV.

## ðŸ“Š 2. Typical Outputs

| Output                       | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `energy_flows.csv`          | Hourly energy flows by technology and sector    |
| `investment_summary.csv`    | Installed capacities per technology and year    |
| `emissions.csv`             | COâ‚‚ emissions over time                          |
| `costs.csv`                 | CAPEX, OPEX, and total system cost              |
| `curtailment.csv`           | Energy not used due to overproduction           |

## ðŸ§  3. Common Questions to Ask

- Which technologies were selected, and when?
- What is the pathway to net-zero by 2050?
- What are the peak loads and how are they covered?
- Where are inefficiencies or curtailments happening?
- What is the total cost of the transition?

---

## ðŸ“¤ 4. Export and Report

You can export results to CSV/Excel to build reports or feed into dashboards. Use this data to:

- Inform policy
- Compare scenarios
- Communicate results to stakeholders

---

## ðŸªœ Next Steps

- Try varying demand profiles or policy constraints
- Compare different municipal zones
- Run investment sensitivity studies
